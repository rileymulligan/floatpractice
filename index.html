    <h1>Zoey and Loki</h1>
    <div>
    <img src="images\IMG_1.JPEG" alt="loki 1" style="float:left">
    <p class="gradient-text"> There is sorrow enough in the natural way<br>
        From men and women to fill our day;<br>
        And when we are certain of sorrow in store,<br>
        Why do we always arrange for more?<br>
        Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware<br>
        Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.<br>
    </div>

    <img src="images\IMG_2.JPEG" alt="Zoey 1" style="float:right">
    <p class="gradient-text">Buy a pup and your money will buy<br>
        Love unflinching that cannot lie—<br>
        Perfect passion and worship fed<br>
        By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head.<br>
        Nevertheless it is hardly fair<br>
        To risk your heart for a dog to tear.<br></p>
    
    <img src="images\IMG_3.JPEG" alt="Zoey 2" style="float:left">
    <p class="gradient-text">When the fourteen years which Nature permits<br>
        Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,<br>
        And the vet&#39;s unspoken prescription runs<br>
        To lethal chambers or loaded guns,<br>
        Then you will find—it&#39;s your own affair—<br>
        But … you&#39;ve given your heart to a dog to tear.<br></p>

    <img src="images\IMG_4.JPEG" alt="Zoey 3" style="float:right">
    <p class="gradient-text">When the body that lived at your single will,<br>
        With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!).<br>
        When the spirit that answered your every mood<br>
        Is gone—wherever it goes—for good,<br>
        You will discover how much you care,<br>
        And will give your heart to a dog to tear.<br></p>

    <img src="images\IMG_5.JPG" alt="loki 2" style="float:left">
    <p class="gradient-text">We&#39;ve sorrow enough in the natural way,<br>
        When it comes to burying Christian clay.<br>
        Our loves are not given, but only lent,<br>
        At compound interest of cent per cent.<br>
        Though it is not always the case, I believe,<br>
        That the longer we&#39;ve kept &#39;em, the more do we grieve:<br></p>

    <img src="images\IMG_6.JPEG" alt="loki 3"  style="float:right">
    <p class="gradient-text">For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,<br>
        A short-time loan is as bad as a long—<br>
        So why in—Heaven (before we are there)<br>
        Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear?<br></p>
